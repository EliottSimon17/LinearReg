# Assignment: Linear Regression
# In this assignment you will implement Linear Regression for a very simple
# test case. Please fill into the marked places of the code
#   (1) the cost function
#   (2) the update function for Gradient Descent
#
#   Things that need to be updated are marked with "HERE YOU ..."
#
# This assignment is kept very simple on purpose to help you familiarize
# with Matlab and Linear Regression. Feel free to make some useful tests.
# E.g. What happens if the learning rate is too high or too low?
#      Can Linear Regression really find the absolute global minimum?
#      What effect does it have if you change the initial guess for the
#      gradient descent to something completely off?
#      What happens if you are not updating thet0 and thet1
#      "simultaneously" but you are updating both parameters in separate
#      for loops (see below)?
#      You can try to turn this code for Linear Regression into an
#      implementation of Logistic Regression
